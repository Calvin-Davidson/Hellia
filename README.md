# Mythe - Hellia

Mythe is the final assignment for the second year students at Mediacollage Amsterdam. We are a team of 4 artists and 2 developers.

## Story

You are playing as the god Baldr also know as the god of light. You are trying to escape Helheim.


## Mechanics

#### Pushing blocks
You can push blocks in holes so you can progress further through the levels, or you can make a route out of pushable blocks which you can then use to escape the level.

#### Melting blocks
Smeltable blocks can be used when 2 blocks are next to each other. Since you can push only 1 block at a time, you must smelt one to push the other. You need to have a torch to do so, and torches do have a lifespan so you have to be fast.
